### API Declarations

```
'This is a little program I whipped up because a friend
'had 50,000 different links to HTML color chart webpages.
'It has since been expanded to show VB color codes, RGB _and_
'HSL values, and much much more! Enjoy!
'
'-- It displays any color, showing you all 16 text colors
' with the color as background
'
'-- It displays the HTML hex code and the VB hex code for
' that color.
'
'-- It will show you the individual Red/Green/Blue values
' that make up the color (useful if you need to use the
' color in another graphics program such as PhotoShop)
'
'-- It will show you the hue/saturation/luminance values
' for the color (useful for fine-tuning a color) (Hue is
' the tint of a color, saturation is the 'richness' of a
' color (0 is gray), and luminance is the brightness)
'
'-- You can change the HTML, VB, RGB & HSL values and
' instantly see the new color.
'
'-- You can pick a color off of a standard color dialog box
' (it even saves the 'custom colors' between sessions)
'
'-- You can pick a color by sampling a point on the screen
' (make sure the color is showing before you do, if you try
' to minimize a window after you start, you'll just get the
' color of the minimize button instead!)
'
'-- You can sample a 5x5 square around the cursor to get the
' average color that you 'see' (that may not actually be in
' any individual pixel).
'
'-- There are quick color samples to click to adjust the
' brightness +/- 5, 10, 15 or 20 percent.
'
'NEW! BlendBar: Click the top or bottom square to move the current
' color into that 'anchor' color. The bar between will 'blend'
' the two colors with 15 distinct shades between them. Click on
' the bar itself to select a blended color as the current color.
'
'The buttons are all labeled with pictures not words, but you can
'hold the mouse over the button to see what it does.
